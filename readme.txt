Love That Gallery allows the user to build two types of photo galleries and edit customizations for them.

== Description ==

Love That Gallery allows users to upload their own photos, or use the ones already loaded into WordPress's media gallery, and customize them into either a slider based gallery, or a grid based gallery. Both use FancyBox to view the images fullscreen. Admin pages provided allow further customizations to how their photos are used.

== Installation ==

Upload the plugin to the WordPress plugin directory( `/wp-content/plugins/` directory) , activate, and start creating galleries in the Settings section!
